## 🚀 About Me

I’m a software engineer with 3+ years of experience building production systems across gaming, fintech, and enterprise environments. My work focuses on backend development, API engineering, distributed systems, and developer tooling—delivering reliable, maintainable software with strong observability and clear technical documentation.

I’ve engineered secure payment workflows, regulatory-compliant gaming systems, and robust REST/GraphQL integrations with third-party services, including authentication, rate limiting, and error-handling layers. I also bring hands-on experience in operational diagnostics and technical support engineering, including root-cause analysis, incident investigation, and the creation of standardized Confluence and Jira workflows used across multiple product teams.

Outside of work, I enjoy systems problems involving protocol analysis, concurrent C++ data structures, and probabilistic modeling. I like building software where correctness, performance, and resilience matter.
