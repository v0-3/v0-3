## 🚀 About Me

I’m a software engineer with 3+ years of experience building production systems across gaming, fintech, and enterprise environments. My work focuses on backend development, API engineering, distributed systems, and developer tooling—delivering reliable, maintainable software with strong observability and clear technical documentation.

Outside of work, I enjoy systems problems involving protocol analysis, concurrent C++ data structures, and probabilistic modeling. I like building software where correctness, performance, and resilience matter.
